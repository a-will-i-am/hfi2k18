            employers. The majority of his current legal practice is in the field of human resources
            consulting and employment law litigation although he continues select other types of
            disputes for some of his clients. Mr. Van Valkenburgh also teaches the art of
            negotiation to students at the Barry University College of Law in his class

        <p class="black-text" style="text-indent: 50px;">
          Mr. Van Valkenburgh currently mediates all types of business, real estate and employment disputes as well as probate, personal injury and family law matters. Before each mediation, Mr. Van Valkenburgh always reviews the pleadings and any information submitted by the parties and conducts any research necessary to be sure that he is fully informed about the parties, the nature of their dispute and the law that will govern the case at trial. He excels at dealing with highly emotional individuals and establishing excellent rapport with all parties. This rapport allows him to firmly challenge the parties' legal positions, factual contentions and expectations for outcomes outside of the mediation process thereby moving them toward a resolution of their dispute.
